# Emergency Preparedness Starter Guide
This document contains information, guides, and links to documents and videos surrounding emergency preparedness. Specific information was added that is particularly useful to residents of Payson, Utah. The organizational structures, existing plans, and future goals are based on, and directed towards, the individuals and families residing in the boundaries outlined in the map below. The boundaries coincide with the boundaries of a church congregation (the Mountain View 9th Ward), though no membership or activity is assumed or expected. The outlined documents and videos are meant to provide information valuable to all individuals, and define a clear structure that can help in the organization of relief efforts in the case of an emergency. The specific implementation can be adapted to other locations.
