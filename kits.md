This document is a simple guide for what things may belong in your personal/family emergency kits. It is not comprehensive, but meant to provide ideas. You should adjust your kits based on personal needs, budget, and space constraints. The items suggested are directed towards 72 hours of sustainment. It is generally difficult to make 72 hours of preparedness equipment portable, and it is also suggested to have emergency equipment that can be grabbed and taken with you quickly and easily. As a compromise, I suggest having a total 72 hours of kit, with 24 of those 72 hours packed in a standalone bag that can be taken out of the home quickly if necessary. This guide first covers the 24-hour gear, and then covers the additional materials that can turn the total kit into 72 hours of sustainment.
