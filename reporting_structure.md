During emergencies, it is critical to evaluate the well-being of as many people as possible and get help or general communication to everyone. A map below shows a breakdown of the neighborhood in such a way that allows for this reporting structure. Homes are in groups of around 10, called "sections". 5 or 6 sections make up a "group". Ideally, we would like two volunteers from each section, and another two from each group that could be part of the chain of communication.  Two people help provide redundancy, but one person for each role is a fantastic start. The roles are very simple and require very little time or resource commitment.

In the event of an emergency, section leaders would communicate with the families of their section (through whatever communication can happen). They would then report the status or requested help up to the group leader(s). That then can get communicated to the ward and emergency leaders to organize the needed assistance.

In the reverse, if traditional communication methods are unavailable, messages can get passed to group leaders, down to section leaders, down to the individual families.

The only time this would be necessary is in an emergency or for a practice drill to evaluate our abilities. The most difficult role a section leader would need to fill is to go door to door to their 8-10 neighbors (4-5 if there are two section leaders) and check on them or deliver them a message.

Individuals with radio experience and equipment may be particularly suited for these roles, as the reporting may require communicating with those who are not as close in proximity.
